# Normal Distribution:
 This is the shape of the data. It's the classic "bell curve" that tells you how your data is spread out. In your problem, it describes the pattern of how return times are clustered around the average.

# Standard Deviation:
 This is a measurement that tells you how wide or spread out that bell curve is. In your problem, a standard deviation of 3 days tells you the typical amount of time that a return will differ from the average (10 days).

## 1. Normal Distribution (The "Bell Curve")
The normal distribution is a specific, symmetric, bell-shaped probability distribution. It's defined by two parameters: its mean (average) and its standard deviation.

Mean (μ = 10 days): This is the center of the bell curve. It's the most likely value. In this context, more products are returned around the 10-day mark than any other time.

Symmetry: The curve is perfectly symmetrical around the mean. The probability of a product being returned in 9 days is the same as it being returned in 11 days.

The "Empirical Rule": This is a key feature of the normal distribution. It states:

About 68% of the returns will happen within 1 standard deviation of the mean (between 7 and 13 days).

About 95% of the returns will happen within 2 standard deviations of the mean (between 4 and 16 days).

About 99.7% of the returns will happen within 3 standard deviations of the mean (between 1 and 19 days).

## 2. Standard Deviation (σ = 3 days)
The standard deviation is a single number that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of data.

What it measures: It tells you, on average, how far each data point (return time) is from the mean (10 days).

A "Spread Meter":

A small standard deviation (e.g., σ = 0.5 days) would mean the data is tightly clustered around the mean. Most returns would happen between 9.5 and 10.5 days. The bell curve would be very tall and narrow.

A large standard deviation (e.g., σ = 10 days) would mean the data is very spread out. Returns could happen anywhere from 0 to 30 days, with much less predictability. The bell curve would be short and wide.

In your problem (σ = 3 days): This is a "medium" spread. It tells us that while the average return time is 10 days, there is a fair amount of variability. It's common for returns to come in a few days early or a few days late.
